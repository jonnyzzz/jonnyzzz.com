# JetBrains IDE Services Lands on AWS Marketplace: What This Means for Enterprise Developer Experience

**Date:** July 16, 2025  

---

The enterprise software procurement landscape just shifted. JetBrains IntelliJ-based IDEs, 
JetBrains AI, and IDE Provisioner are now available on AWS Marketplace, marking a significant 
milestone in how organizations can acquire and deploy professional developer tools at scale.

This integration represents more than a new purchasing channel. It signals a fundamental shift 
in how enterprises can approach developer experience (DevEx) platforms while maintaining the 
security, compliance, and governance requirements that large organizations demand.

## The Enterprise Developer Tooling Challenge

Anyone who has worked in enterprise IT knows the friction: developers want best-in-class 
tools, while procurement teams need compliant acquisition processes, security teams require vetted 
software, and finance departments demand predictable licensing models.

The challenges are real. Enterprise applications handle sensitive business and customer data, 
making security paramount. Manual compliance checks and reactive assessments leave enterprises 
exposed to risk, while manual procurement processes create inefficiencies.

## What JetBrains IDE Services Actually Offers

IDE Services is not a single product but an umbrella of tools that solve acute development infrastructure challenges:

**IDE Provisioner** centralizes IDE management across versions, configurations, and plugins. Organizations can avoid unapproved or outdated IDE versions, supporting everything from IntelliJ IDEA to GoLand, PyCharm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, WebStorm, and Android Studio.

**License Vault** automates license distribution with three licensing models: pre-paid, fully postpaid, and mixed IDE licensing. Floating licenses release back to the pool after 20 minutes of inactivity, maximizing utilization.

**Code With Me Enterprise** brings real-time collaboration to remote development teams, supporting pair programming and allowing up to five developers to edit the same file simultaneously.

**AI Enterprise** runs on-premises as part of IDE Services, ensuring complete control over data and AI operations within your organization's infrastructure.

## Why AWS Marketplace Matters

For organizations already operating in AWS environments, this integration offers concrete benefits:

- **Streamlined procurement**: Leverage existing AWS relationships and billing arrangements
- **Consolidated billing**: Software costs flow through existing AWS billing infrastructure
- **Compliance acceleration**: AWS Marketplace vendors undergo vetting processes
- **Scale-ready deployment**: Provision IDE Services alongside existing AWS infrastructure

## The Vision: Secure, Scalable DevEx

What makes this announcement significant is the broader vision: a secure, scalable DevEx 
platform that lets enterprises adopt IDEs and AI with confidence while keeping developers happy.

The on-premises deployment option for AI features is particularly noteworthy. As organizations 
increasingly adopt AI coding assistants, questions about code privacy and data sovereignty become more pressing.

## Looking Forward

For enterprise teams evaluating developer experience platforms:

1. The friction between developer tools and enterprise requirements is being actively addressed
2. AI capabilities are becoming table stakes for enterprise development environments
3. Procurement channels matter -- acquiring tools through existing cloud vendor relationships removes barriers to adoption

The enterprise developer tools landscape continues to evolve. JetBrains IDE Services on 
AWS Marketplace represents one significant step toward making enterprise-grade developer experience achievable at scale.
