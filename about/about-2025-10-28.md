I build developer tools that scale, including Gen AI. At JetBrains for 20+ years, I've gone from coding ReSharper and TeamCity to leading an enterprise product suite.

Most recently: Launched IDE Services commercial suite from zero → 500+ companies, 100K+ developers, multi-million $ revenue in Year 1. Built both SaaS and on-premises enterprise AI governance and productivity tools.

Before that: Created Toolbox App (started as my hackathon project, now powers enterprise IDE management). Delivered enterprise features for TeamCity. 42+ conference talks on Kotlin and developer productivity.

I solve problems at the intersection of AI governance, developer experience, and enterprise scale.
