After 20 years at JetBrains, I've learned that the best developer tools emerge when we combine deep technical expertise with genuine empathy for developers' daily challenges. This balance has guided my journey from ReSharper and TeamCity development to leading IDE Services product offerings for enterprise customers today.

Starting as a developer on ReSharper, TeamCity, and Upsource, I've been fortunate to work on projects that shape how millions of developers write code. My path evolved through Git Hosting and Shared Indexes to leading more impactful initiatives in IDE Services, where we're pushing the boundaries of what developer tools can do at the company or enterprise scale.

My passion lies at the intersection of developer productivity and team empowerment. Whether it's optimizing IDE performance, streamlining team workflows, deploying AI tools, or mentoring the next generation of engineers, I'm driven by making developers' lives better. The Toolbox App started as my hackathon and 20% project (those long evenings coding in Qt C++) and became something that now powers our enterprise IDE management - proof that great things happen when technical curiosity meets persistent experimentation.

In my work, I successfully blend technical solutions, customer insights, and business needs to deliver viable products. With 42+ conference talks under my belt (mostly about Kotlin and developer productivity), I've learned that sharing knowledge is as important as creating it. Now I'm using these skills while talking with our customers or internal teams.

Core expertise: Platform Architecture | Technical Strategy | Team Building | IntelliJ Platform | Kotlin (using it since before 1.0!) | Large-Scale Systems | DevEx Innovation | B2B

Nowadays, I'm focused on scaling developer productivity solutions for enterprise teams while maintaining a technical involvement that keeps me grounded. Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss AI, IntelliJ platform, Kotlin, just developer tools, or B2B/Enterprise products.
